Named Entity Recognition DNN code

Author : Sangkeun Jung 

- This code contains 
	- basic concept of buliding DNN for N2N problem ("TUTORIAL" purpose only)
        - Lecture Blog : http://hugman.re.kr/blog/ner/

	- application is named entity recognition 

	- input sequence  : user sentence
	- output sequence : naemd entity tags (BIO tags)

	- You can upgrade the model by
		- Attention mechanism
		- bidirectional RNN
		- Conditional Random Field in top layer
		- and many other techniques.
